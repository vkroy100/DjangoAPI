# InsuranceAmountPredictorWebApplication
This projects does calculation of the insurance amount on the basis of various details provided by the user.To make the predictions, a Deep Learning model (Neural Network) is trained with a self made dataset which predicts amount of insurance based on the information like age,diseases,habits (smoking,drinking) etc. This trained model is then integrated with the django framework with the help of REST APIs to build a web application and this also is served on AWS using a micro ec2 instance. All the computations for successful predictions are done in the background in the server. In this project the model achived the accuracy of 96% in predicting the insurance amount.We have tried various machine learning models like Decision Trees, Linear Regression, Neural Networks etc. And we have found best prediction on the neural networks.
